A Node.js app is build with express, ejs, sequelize.
By building this app I practiced my skills with the above-mentioned tools as well as applying sessions, authentications, validations and error handling. Also working with images' data and displaying it on a map.
The main focus of the app was building the backend infrastructure.
# How to run the app:
Clone the repo and install the dependencies.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bongoslav/apartments-rent-app.git
cd apartments-rent-app
```
```sh
npm install
```

Start the app by running:
```sh
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000.
